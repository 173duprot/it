Simpler than zen, less precepts, less assumptions.
No religion, no phliosophy, no practice.

Its name shall be whatever term shows it clearly.
It's not a religion or practice. 
It's a natural subtlety of life obtained by one's-self.
It's not instant.
It's a cultavation.
It's the most direct approach.
Do not supress either body or mind.
Observe the present state. What is its logic? What is it's guiding pattern?
Be the most honest you ever can be too yourself, about everything.
With this awareness, dispell illusions.
If there's no awnser, stop seeking.
You already have it because you are it.

--- Detachment sucks ---

"Detatchment" is truely a terribly translated word that pervaudes psudo-eastern phliosophy.

Words like "Detachment", "ego", etc. all nonsense and sidestreets, the english word is nothing but a deciever here.

Ego or non-ego,
attachment or disattachment
Seek instead understanding and the whole world opens up to you.

Understand and you can act.
Act and you will understand better.
This is how wisdom grows.
