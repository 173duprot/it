Simpler than zen, less precepts, less assumptions.
No religion, no phliosophy, no practice.

Its name shall be whatever term shows it clearly.
It's not a religion or practice. 
It's a natural subtlety of life obtained by one's-self.
It's not instant.
It's a cultavation.
It's the most direct approach.
Do not supress either body or mind.
Compassionately care for body and mind.
Observe the present state. What is its logic? What is it's guiding pattern?
Be the most honest you ever can be too yourself, about everything.
With this awareness, dispell illusions.
If there's no awnser, stop seeking.
You already have it because you are it.
