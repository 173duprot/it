Simpler than zen, less precepts, less assumptions.
No religion, no phliosophy, no practice.

Its name shall be whatever term shows it clearly.
It's not a religion or practice. 
It's a natural subtlety of life obtained by one's-self.
It's not instant.
It's a cultavation.
It's the most direct approach.
Do not supress either body or mind.
Remember thoughts are guesses.
Remember emotions cloud thoughts.

Observe the present state.
- What is its logic?
- What is it's guiding pattern?
- Identify that state, learn your states.

Be the most honest you ever can be too yourself, about everything.
With this new awareness, dispell illusions.
With this new awareness, act accordingly.
With this new awareness, become healthy.

Do not look to texts, masters, guides.
Consider only what works, and only when it becomes apparent.

and if there's no awnser, stop seeking.

--- Detachment sucks ---

"Detatchment" is truely a terribly translated word that pervaudes psudo-eastern phliosophy.

Words like "Detachment", "ego", etc. all nonsense and sidestreets, the english word is nothing but a deciever here.

Ego or non-ego,
attachment or disattachment
Seek instead understanding and the whole world opens up to you.

Understand and you can act.
Act and you will understand better.
This is how wisdom grows.

--- Care

Your mental well-being is like an animal, care for it, give it a good enviroment, a good "context", put the proper effort into taking care of it and it will grant you the world.

Forsake it, fill it with bad thougths, unhealthy beliefs, bad enviroment, and chemical imbalances, and it will degrade.

All is mind, this care changes the very way reality is viewed. 

Start with self-care, mental and physical, and all will be unlocked.
